      <ACI-Related-Party-Disclosure>1</ACI-Related-Party-Disclosure>
      <Executive-Summary>The objective and intention of the inspection and this report is to provide the client/end user with information relating to the installed Air Conditioning/Comfort Cooling systems (AC) and Ventilation Systems and endeavour to provide ideas and recommendations for the site to reduce its CO2 emissions, lower energy consumption and save money on energy bills.

        BUILDING TYPE/DETAILS:

        The site inspected was; A Shop located in London. The site was inspected on the 20th May 2019. The estimated total floor area provided with air conditioning/comfort cooling (AC) on site was circa; 1876m2.

        The construction of the building comprised a small shopping centre type arrangement which appeared predominantly of brick construction with flat concrete roof and would be estimated to be from circa the 1960’s/70’s. Windows appeared double glazed.


        INSTALLED AC SYSTEM TYPE/DETAILS:

        The AC systems installed on site were;
        • 4Nr 10kW R410A Mitsubishi Heavy Industries inverter driven split AC condensers interconnected to indoor cassette units within the Sales Area dating from circa 2014. Areas included secondary heaters at ceiling level and natural ventilation. The systems included local controllers and were linked to a central BMS controller which was advised as being set and monitored off site at head office; this was located in the manager’s office. (3Nr of the 4Nr systems were inspected to provide a representative inspection in accordance with TM44 sampling guidance).

        The total cooling output of the installed systems located on site was calculated to be circa 40kW.


        SAMPLING STATEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH DCLG GUIDANCE:

        For this site sampling was undertaken in accordance with TM44 sampling guideline.


        COMMENTS ON CONTROLS/MAINTENANCE/OPERATION:

        AC SYSTEM(s) 1: (VOL001/SYS001) – 3Nr Sampled systems from the 4Nr 10kW R410A Mitsubishi Heavy Industries inverter driven split AC condensers interconnected to indoor cassette units within the Sales Area dating from circa 2014.


        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        DOCUMENTATION:

        The F Gas register was requested whilst onsite but was not available for review, it is recommended that an F Gas Register be provided onsite in accordance with the current F Gas Regulations. All refrigerant charges for the inspected systems are estimated from information available from equipment data plates reviewed on site during the inspection.


        ADDITIONAL INFORMATION / GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:

        Consider installing energy sub meters - these are used to monitor all energy used for provision of AC/cooling systems, (also consider for; heating, ventilation and hot water etc) for the building. Collate this information and compare to published energy benchmarks for a similar type of building. Also compare energy use for each service on an annual basis to try and reduce energy use from previous years. If the energy cannot be measured then it shall be difficult to save energy &amp; monitor any energy saving that is achieved.
