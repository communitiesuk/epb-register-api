# epb-register-api

## Prerequisites

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* Bundler (run `gem install bundler`)

## Installing
`bundle install`

## Creating a local database

Ensure you have Postgres 11 installed. If you are working on a Mac, [this tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb) will take you through the process.

You will need to have a user with the role name postgres, which has the `Create DB` and `Superuser` permissions to create databases and install the `fuzzystrmatch` extension.

Once you have set this up, run the command to set up and seed your local database

`make seed-local-db`

### You will need to set the following environment variables

`export STAGE=test`

Set the endpoint of unleash to be any valid URL. You will need to run your own local version of unleash if you want to use feature toggles.  

`export EPB_UNLEASH_URI=https://google.com`

To decode and validate JWTs passed in to the API the environment variables `JWT_ISSUER` and `JWT_SECRET` need to be set. 
The values for these should match those on the auth server being connected to.

`export JWT_ISSUER=dev.issuer`
`export JWT_SECRET=dev.secret`

## Running tests
`make test`

## Running server
`make run`

This will make the API available at `http://localhost:9191`. 

## Code Formatting 
To run Rubocop:

`make format`

# CI
Build commands are stored in the buildspec directory
